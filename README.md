# ATimeTool
Time tracking with Arduino Nano and  MPU6050

// How we spend our days is, of course how we spend our lives. Annie Dillard

Building a device to gather exactly this info - how do we spend our days?

This is a simple but really useful arduino project to track time events during your day by moving the box from side to side.
 
You can move it to "Task 1 - Rest" > "Task 2 - Learn" > "Task 3 - Chores" > "Task 4 - Work" side and it will gather the time you have used on that particular activity. 
 
ATimeTool is built on Arduino Nano and MPU6050 breakout board - this tool is built for workshop ‘Game of Optimisation’ and presented during Tool Fair XV - Back To The Future, with aim to be used as an entry point for talking about wellbeing of young people and their involvement in data driven world. 
 
ATimeTool is built to fit a box (cardboard/3D printed - your call) on which you can draw or place stickers with the names of activities as well as symbols/icons. Data on the activities/time can be gathered and exported to do further data analysis.  
There commercially successful products that can offer that - or more. There is another DIY project that can be used and was greatly described at Adafruit page.  http://learn.adafruit.com/time-tracking-cube. 
 
It can be done simple - for use in classroom or training. To track time data you don't need any wifi or bluetooth internet connection to the cloud services. 

Time Cube is powered and connected to PC by USB cable. On computer you have to run only  serial monitor and copy the data to csv - from arduino and displays total spent time.
